# Project Infrastructure

Welcome to the infrastructure documentation for our project! 🚀 This guide provides an overview of the robust and scalable architecture we've implemented to power our application. From containerized services to a secure firewall setup, we've designed an environment that ensures reliability, performance, and maintainability.

## Key Components

- **LXD Containers**: Leverage the power of Linux containers for isolated and efficient deployment. Our containers include app servers, a load balancer, a PostgreSQL database, a DNS server, and a firewall to control traffic.

- **Load Balancer (Nginx)**: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple app servers, ensuring high availability and optimal performance. Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, seamlessly routing requests to the appropriate backend services.

- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Store and manage data with the robust PostgreSQL database. Our setup includes secure configurations, remote access, and efficient data handling.

- **DNS Server (BIND9)**: Facilitate domain resolution within our network. BIND9 is configured to handle local zones, providing efficient and reliable DNS services.

- **Firewall (iptables)**: Secure our infrastructure with a finely tuned firewall. Control incoming traffic, allowing only essential connections to pass through and safeguarding our environment.

## Deployment Workflow

Our deployment workflow automates the setup and configuration of each component. Using GitHub Actions, create a Docker image, configure services, and deploy our application seamlessly. The workflow ensures consistency and repeatability in our deployment process.

## Getting Started

Whether you're a new contributor or setting up the project locally, the documentation provides step-by-step instructions to replicate our infrastructure. Dive in and explore the architecture that powers our application.
